        Wayanad is unlike any destination in Kerala. Neolithic humans to troops of Tippu Sultan 
        have scouted these woods. From the Edakkal Caves to millennia-old Jain temples, 
        Wayanad has everything to please the history buff in you. Take the jeep safari through the Muthanga forest, 
        explore some of the off-beat wonders or have a hand in the bamboo rafting in Kuruva 
        Island. Wayanad is unblemished nature served on a rosewood platter. Chembra peak, Banasura 
        Sagar dam, Pookode lake... The list goes on. Put on your trekking boots and hike off the 
        beaten track.

    <h3>Top Spots</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><h1>Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/wayanad-wildlife-sanctuary.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 200px;">
      <p>Spread over an area of 345 sq. km., Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is the second largest wildlife sanctuary in Kerala. Rich in 
        biodiversity, the sanctuary is an integral part of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.</p>
      <p>Thousands of tourists flock to this heavenly abode every year to witness the exotic 
        flora and fauna of Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary which consists of tropical moist 
        dry deciduous, evergreen forests, bamboo thickets and plantations. One of the 
        major attractions is undoubtedly the large population of pachyderms. Elephants 
        roam freely in the wilderness and you can spot a variety of wildlife such as tigers, 
        panthers, jungle cats, civet cats, monkeys and wild dogs. Blessed with its endless 
        population of birds like cuckoos, woodpeckers, peacocks, babblers, owls, jungle 
        fowls etc., Wayanad is every bird watcher's paradise.</p>

      <li><h1>Banasura Sagar Dam</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/banasura-sagar-dam.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 170px;">
      <p>Fancy visiting the largest earth dam in India with a connection to perhaps Kerala's most 
        well-known mythical king and also find out what a fish pedicure feels like before you head 
        back? Then it is the Banasura Dam, Wayanad, where you have to head to. Named after 
        the son of Mahabali and made of stones and boulders, the dam packs a charm like no 
        other.</p>
      <p>The dam stands across the Karamanathodu, which is a tributary of the Kabini river. It is 
        an ideal picnic spot, with breathtaking views all around. Some of the tallest peaks of the 
        Western Ghats, including the Banasura Hill, are nearby.</p>
      <br>
      <li><h1>Kanthanpara Waterfalls</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/kanthanpara.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 208px;">
      <p>With ever shiny rocks, both caressed and pummelled constantly by white water, 
        Kanthanpara waterfalls are yet another jewel of Wayanad. Tucked amidst the thick 
        rainforest is this serene spot, where one can truly feel cut off from the tentacles of 
        civilization, lost in sheer admiration of the beauty of the rainforest. Interestingly, in the 
        local tongue, Kanthanpara translates to 'magnetic rock'.</p>
      <p>The air here is cool and crisp all the year round, owing to the thickly forested areas close 
        by. Often mist-clad, the falls are a sight indeed. Cascading down into two sections, the 
        second drop is the deeper of the two, with a depth of about 30m.</p>
      <p></p>
      <br>
      <li><h1>The Edakkal Caves</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/Edakkal_Caves.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 190px;">
      <p>The Edakkal Caves in Wayanad are steeped in mystery. Located at an elevation of 1200 ft 
        above sea level, they have been fascinating both tourists and historians alike, since their 
        discovery in 1895. The paintings and carvings inside the cave, that date back to at least 
        6000 BC, indicate the presence of ancient human inhabitants in the area. It is believed 
        that human beings had been present here at many different times of history</p>
      <p>The word 'Edakkal' translates to 'a stone in between'. The inclusion of the word 'caves' 
        however, is a misnomer as these are not real caves. They were part of a larger historical 
        monument and several beliefs are associated with their origin.</p>
