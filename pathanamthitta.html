        Home to many temples, heritage villages and cultural training centres, Pathanamthitta 
        is also renowned for the annual 'Vallasadya', which is held at the Aranmula 
        Sree Parthasarathy Temple. This grand festive occasion continues to attract travellers 
        from far and wide. The place is also the hub of Kathakali, classical art forms and Kalaripayattu, and is known for its fairs and festivals.
