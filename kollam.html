        Kollam, known by its former name Quilon and Koolam (in Arabic), Coul√£o (in Portuguese), and Desinganadu, is an ancient seaport and city on the Malabar Coast bordering the Laccadive Sea, 
        which is a part of the Arabian Sea. The city is on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada river. Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since the days of the Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews, Chaldeans and Romans. 
        Fed by the Chinese trade, it was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels.

    <h3>Top Spots</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><h1>Jatayupara</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/jatayupara.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 200px;">
      <p>Jatayupara is a hillock in Chadayamangalam, Kollam that features a stunningly colossal statue of Jatayu. Popular belief has it that the vulture-king mentioned in the epic
        <i>Ramayana</i> fell on this rocky hill when Ravana sliced off its wing during an aerial combat as Jatayu tried to prevent the abduction of Sita.</p>
      <p>Considered the world's largest bird sculpture, it has a rock theme park and an adventure centre for sports enthusiasts. The 60 ft. 
        tall, 150 ft. broad and 200 ft. long figure of the fallen bird stands as a symbol of valour and sacrifice. The Jatayu Earth's Center offers a bird's eye view from 1000 ft. above sea level</p>
      <br>
      <li><h1>Punalur</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/Punalur.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 170px;">
      <p>Punalur is located near theeastern border of Kollam district and the banks of the Kallada River. It is also the largest hill city in India. Situated 
        on the Kollam - Shencottah - Thenkasi highway near the state border, this town is the main transit point for goods from South Kerala to Tamil Nadu. </p>
      <p>The highlight of Punalur's tourism is the hanging bridge, the only one-of-its-kind in South India, which is also called the London Bridge of Kerala. The picturesque Kallada River in 
        Punalur also draws many visitors. As Punalur is a stopover for Sabarimala pilgrims, the Department of Tourism has constructed a bathing ghat on the shores of the Kallada to provide food and accommodation facilities to the pilgrims.</p>

      <li><h1>Thenmala</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/thenmala.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 170px;">
      <p>Thenmala is another attraction for those who love to explore Nature. This is the first planned eco-tourism destination in India. The 
        lush green terrain of Thenmala, dotted with forests and rubber plantations, was selected by the World Tourism Organisation 
        as one of the best eco-friendly tourism projects. It spreads over ten eco-tourism spots that cover the hill ranges of Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta and Kollam districts. </p>
      <p>Trekking, boating, tenting, bird watching, mountain biking, rock climbing, rappelling and river crossing are some of the activities in store for adventure enthusiasts. Apart 
        from these, Thenmala also has a leisure zone with winding pathways, a sway bridge, asculpture garden, a boardwalk, a culture zone with an amphitheatre, and a musical
        fountain. There is also a deer rehabilitation centre nearby, which is ideal for informational and recreational tours.</p>

      <img src="/images/ayiramthengu.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 208px;">
      <p>The Ayiramthengu Mangrove forest is a lush green haven that supports a diverse variety of aquatic and terrestrial creatures. The State Fisheries Department maintains this
        dynamic ecosystem which was restored from the brink of extinction a few years ago. </p>
      <p>Amidst the abundant red mangroves, the rare Lumnitzera Racemosa species of mangroves can also be found here. The forest also serves as a nesting ground for a variety of migratory birds.</p> 
      <br>
      <li><h1>Palaruvi Waterfalls</h1></li>
      <img src="/images/palaruvi.jpg" alt="." height="500px" style="padding-left: 208px;">
      <p>The picturesque Palaruvi Waterfall is situated amidst a dense patch of tropical forest in Kollam. As its 
        name suggests, the waterfall resembles a milky stream gushing down a rocky terrain. The stream traces its course through 
        a range of medicinal plants and herbs in the forest that are known to have therapeutic properties.</p>
      <p>The site of the waterfall serves as a perfect picnic spot with the surrounding lush green forest. It offers a view of the pictorial hazy blue mountains, and provides a chance for a refreshing dip in the waters.</p>
