        Kottayam is the hub of letters, lakes, and latex. The district has a rich literary tradition and is the birthplace of the publishing industry in Kerala. It is here that 
        the first seeds of the Fourth Estate were sown. Many of the state's leading newspaper publications and periodicals had its first print from Kottayam. The contribution of the 
        district to print media and literature earned for Kottayam the name 'Akshara Nagari' or the 'land of letters'. The land is luxuriously 
        covered with rubber plantations, hence the sobriquet 'land of latex'. Kottayam made great strides in the industrial sector with its rubber-based industries, which figure as its backbone.

      <img src="images/kumarakom.webp" alt="." height="500px" width="700px" style="float: left;padding-right: 30px;">
      <p>Kumarakom is a land of backwaters in which every eddy has a story to share. This quaint village sitting 
        on a group of little islands in the serene Vembanad Lake is only 16 km away from Kottayam town. </p>
      <p>For visitors who want to stay close to Nature, there is Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary. Spread across 14 acres on the 
        banks of Vembanad Lake, it is a favourite haunt of migratory birds like the Siberian Storks, and an ideal location to 
        spot other birds like egrets, darters, herons, teals, waterfowls, cuckoos and wild ducks as well. </p>
      <p>In addition to an enchanting backwater cruise, Kumarakom offers visitors opportunities to interact closely with the local community by 
        encouraging them to participate in activities like roof thatching, coir spinning and fishing.</p>

      <img src="images/illikkal.jpg" alt="." height="500px" width="700px" style="float: left;padding-right: 30px;">
      <p>Illikkal Kallu, or the Illikkal Stone, is a monolith, sitting on the Illikkal Hill about 6000 ft. above sea level. Each of the three 
        hills has a unique shape and rises 4000 ft. or more above the ground.</p>
      <p>One of them resembles a mushroom and is called Kuda Kallu, or the Umbrella Rock. Another hill has a small hunch on its side and 
        is hence called Koonu Kallu, or the Hunchbacked Rock. Connecting these two hills is Narakapalam, or the Bridge of Hell, a narrow bridge 
        about half-a-feet-wide. Illikkal Hill is one of the highest peaks in the Western Ghats, and it lures tourists with its enchanting beauty.</p>

      <img src="images/aruvikuzhi.jpg" alt="." height="500px" width="700px" style="float: left;padding-right: 30px;">
      <p>Aruvikuzhy Waterfalls, situated 22 km from Kottayam, offer the right mixture of excitement and serenity. Nestled 
        amidst rubber plantations, it makes an ideally quiet picnic spot. At the same time, the water cascading from the 
        hills above, through 100 ft., makes it attractive for trekking enthusiasts as well.</p>
      <p>The famous St. Mary's Church is situated uphill. The rubber plantation centre at Pallickathode is just 1 km from 
        Aruvikuzhy Waterfalls.</p>

        <b>Murinjupuzha</b> backwaters offer glimpses into the unique village lifestyle of Kerala. Here, tourists can get a feel of the traditional fishing 
        techniques of the locals and a taste of their signature dishes. </p>
