        It is also the 19th largest in the country with a population of two million according to the 2011 census.
        In antiquity and the medieval period, Kozhikode was dubbed the <i>City of Spices</i> for its role as the major trading point for Indian spices. 
        It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins). The port at Kozhikode acted as the gateway to medieval South Indian coast for the Chinese, the Arabs, the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the British.
